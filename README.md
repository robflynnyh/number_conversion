# number_conversion
For use with num2words (pls install)
- num2words converts numbers to their alphabetic form
- it only handles numbers, i.e you can't pass it a text document that includes numbers and text
- use this lib to do just that, it will convert a text document with numbers in to just text
- options for manually handling edge cases where there is a word that includes a number
- my use-case if for prepping ASR training datasets where you typically don't want numbers in there numeric form
- WiP!!!!
